== Description ==

Completely customise your Custom Columns with a nice drag and drop interface. 

By default, WordPress only shows a few built-in columns. This plugin will give you many additional columns and you will have full control over all custom columns for pages, posts, posttypes and users. You can add or remove columns, change their label and reorder them.

= Custom Columns  =

The following custom columns are added:

* Featured Image
* Excerpt
* Post Attachments
* Page Order
* Page Templates
* Post Formats
* Taxonomies
* ID
* Slug
* Sticky
* Word count
* Number of Attachments
* Custom Fields

= Custom Fields =

With the custom field column you can display any custom field values. It can show its default value but also handle it as an image or icon. Thsese types are added:

* Image thumbnails
* Icons for Media Library items
* Excerpt
* Multiple Values
* Numeric value ( this also works for sorting by meta_value_num )

= Sortable Custom Columns =

A nice feature is that it will make some of the new columns support sorting. By default WordPress let's you sort by Title, Date, Comments and Author. This will make you be able to sort by:

* ID
* page order
* slug 
* page template
* word count
* attachment count
* custom fields ( both meta_value and meta_value_num are supported )

= User Columns =

You can also change the User Columns. The following user columns are added:

* User ID
* First name
* Last name
* Url
* Register date
* Biographical Info ( description )
* User Custom Fields

Some of the user custom fields that are included: user level, capabilities, admin color, nickname... many more.


= Third party plugin support =

It will work nice with other plugins and support their additional custom columns. A few examples of plugins that are supported: WordPress SEO by Yoast (Robots Meta), Post Admin Shortcuts (Pin), WP Show IDs (ID) and User Access Manager (Access).
